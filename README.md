- Encoders, decoders, and seven-segment displays 
- Asynchronous and synchronous counters 
- Level-sensitive and edge-sensitive behavior modeling
- Digital data representation and conversions 
- Sequence analyzers and finite state machine design 
- Combinational and sequential multiplier circuits 
- First-in first-out (FIFO) buffer design
